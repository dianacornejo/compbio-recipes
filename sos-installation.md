## Install SoS workflow and notebook in MacOS

1. Make sure you have python 3.6 or more installed
2. Run the following commmands for SoS-workflow (worked for me)
    ```
    pip3.7 install sos
    pip3.7 install sos-pbs
    ```
3. Run the following commands for SoS-notebook
    ```
    pip3.7 install sos-notebook
    pip3.7 install sos-papermill
    pip3.7 install sos-r
    
    ```
